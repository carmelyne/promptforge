• Target platform
  – Web-only SPA, no Electron for now

• Framework / Tooling
  – Vue 3 + Vite + Composition API

• SQLite integration
  – Use sql.js (WASM SQLite) for fully client-side storage

• State management
  – Pinia (lightweight and Vue-native)

• “Prompt preview integration” scope
  – Postpone for MVP. Just store prompts for now.

• Authentication / API keys
  – No built-in key management for now, just include a placeholder or stub for future use
